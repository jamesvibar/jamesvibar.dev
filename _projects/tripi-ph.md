  Working closely with Pelago Inc., we created an eCommerce platform that aims to sell and deliver products/groceries to Filipinos during the COVID-19 pandemic. I was responsible for the creation of customer geolocation module, website front-end modifications, the extension of core Odoo modules, and general server management.
