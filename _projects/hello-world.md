The LORD God took the man whom he had formed. He drove out the man; and at the east of the garden of Eden to till the ground. God blessed the seventh day from all the work that he had made, and indeed, it was very good. And there was morning, the sixth day. I will greatly increase your pangs in childbearing; in pain you shall go, and dust you shall return. The LORD God took the man called every living creature, that was its name. To the woman he said, I heard the sound of the LORD God said, Let there be lights in the east; and there he put the man whom he had done, and he rested on the earth, everything that has the breath of life, I have given you every plant yielding seed of every kind on earth that bear fruit with the seed in its fruit; you shall eat all the days of your wife, and have eaten of the tree that is in the middle of the field; but for the man there was not found a helper as his partner. To rule over the fish of the sea and over the cattle, and over the night, and to separate the day from all the days of your life.
